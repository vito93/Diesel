# Diesel

This is a VS 2019 solution with an SQL Server project inside. You may want to take a look at Diesel.dbo.vw_DieselJournalByMinutes view.

Database version - 150.

Note that in case you have intersecting periods for one machine you my have invalid number of minutes for the machine-date pair. That's an issue discovered on the input data. It may be fixed, but this project is a quick one.
